# Movie Studio Data Analysis Project

## Overview  
This project analyzes movie data to understand key factors influencing box office success. Using datasets from Bom.movie_gross and IMDb, we explore profitable genres, the impact of movie ratings on revenue, and the role of studio size. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for launching a new movie studio.

## Business Understanding  
Our stakeholders are the leadership team of a company launching a new movie studio with limited industry experience.  
Key business questions include:  
- Which movie genres generate the highest revenue?  
- Do higher-rated movies earn significantly more?  
- How do major studios compare with independent ones in terms of financial success?  
- Are there observable trends in genre popularity over recent years?
